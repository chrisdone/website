[Hell](https://github.com/chrisdone/hell) is a shell scripting
language that is a tiny dialect of Haskell.

I'm using it to [generate this blog](https://github.com/chrisdone/hell/blob/main/examples/19-blog-generator.hell), instead of Hakyll.

There's [a set of slides](/pdfs/tour-of-hell.pdf) I made for presenting Hell at work.
