Here's a small blog post to end 2022. I've put together a list of things I've changed my
mind about over the past few years, since the epoch (covid). I'm likely to flesh out each 
of these in future posts.

Things I have a new appreciation for:

1. Excel
2. Rich Hickey
3. Model checkers, TLA+
4. Federation
5. Kubernetes
6. Email
7. Alan Kay
8. REST/Hypermedia
9. Go
10. RSS, blogging
11. Error handling in Erlang
12. Code vs data

Things I view more negatively:

1. Product types (as opposed to record types)
4. Static types, dependent types
5. Haskell and Haskellers, Rust
6. The cloud and SaaS
9. Fat clients/ the SPA
10. React
11. macOS: it isn’t that great
12. Open source, copyleft, GitHub
13. "Performance is easy"
14. Kubernetes (yaml)
18. Modules
20. Effect systems 
21. Twitter, and microblogging

New things I believe/in:

1. Longevity in software
2. Stability in packages
3. Content Addressable Storage, Unison
4. Conservativism
5. Parsimony 
6. Common Lisp is valuable because it does everything it does, without ever changing or evolving.

Things I still believe/in:

1. Emacs reigns supreme
2. No-code isn’t good
3. Nix is not ready yet
