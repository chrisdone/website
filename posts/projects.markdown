# Introduction

It might be a "getting old[-er]" thing, but I've recently started feeling like documenting the complete set of software projects I've worked on that I remember.
Not as a CV (an advertisement of paid work), but a comprehensive list of *everything*.

I'll start with the old stuff and continuously make updates a little bit per day.
After a few weeks I should be done.

# 2006

## SLSK/Soulski

A project for the Soulseek music sharing network.
Web site, which may not remain long-term: [slsk.sourceforge.net](https://slsk.sourceforge.net/).
Amusingly, it still looks great. [Here's a screenshot.](/images/blog/slsk-screenshot-2007.png)
[Another](/images/blog/slsk.jpeg).
I started writing a C library for Soulseek: [soulseek-library-0.01.zip](/archives/2006/soulski/soulseek-library-0.01.zip)
I started writing a GUI library in C for it: [exgui-library-0.1.zip](/archives/2006/soulski/exgui-library-0.1.zip)
I started writing a CSS parser in C for it: [css-library-prototype-0.01.zip](/archives/2006/soulski/css-library-prototype-0.01.zip)

I originally had big ambitions for this, but later lost interest. It
looks like I planned to rewrite it in Common Lisp, but got bored of
the project before I did.

## WDN

I had a project called 'windows desktop notes' (WDN), that I
originally [wrote in C](/archives/2006/wdm/slsk-code-r110-wdm.zip). It
would overlay some plain text notes on your desktop and you could
click it and get an edit box and then hit Enter to save again.

Then I ported it, or tried to, [to Lisp](/archives/2006/wdn/wdn.lisp).
