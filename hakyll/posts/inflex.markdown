Inflex® is a new creative digital workspace: powerful functional language (Haskell-inspired), rich data structures (no grid!), browser-based.

That's the tagline.

The frank explanation is that Inflex is a project that I've
been working on in my spare time, along with my partner,
Giulia Costa, for 2 years. Progress is slow.

You can (for now) checkout our Twitter [InflexHQ](https://twitter.com/InflexHQ)
feed for screenshots, videos and updates.

There used to be a homepage on inflex.io on a beefy Hetzner
server, but that's shut down now to cut expenses. Besides,
I am moving away from the cloud towards a more user-empowering
desktop experience.

I'll expand on this in future updates. There will be a desktop
program to download, more explanations, screenshots, etc.
