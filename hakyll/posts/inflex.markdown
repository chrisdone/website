Inflex is a project that I've been working on in my 
spare time, along with my wife, Giulia Costa, for 2 years.

There used to be a homepage on inflex.io on a beefy Hetzner 
server, but that's shut down now to cut expenses. Besides,
I am moving away from the cloud towards a more user-empowering
desktop experience.

I'll expand on this in future updates. There will be a desktop
program to download, more explanations, screenshots, etc.
