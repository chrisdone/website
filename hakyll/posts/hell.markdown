Hell is a shell scripting 
language 
and implementation
based on Haskell.

Supports:

* UTF-8 and binary file I/O
* UTF-8 text operations (via `text`)
* Stdout/stderr/stdin I/O
* Directory, arguments, environment variables
* Concurrency (via `async`)
* Recursion (via `fix`)
* Running processes (via `typed-process`)

**Quick example**

This script demonstrates 
using `curl`
to download things 
concurrently.

```haskell
main = do

  -- Run two things concurrently and return both results
  (left, right) :: (Text, Text) <-
    Async.concurrently @Text @Text
       (Main.curl "https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Europe/London")
       (Main.curl "https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Europe/Rome")
  Text.putStrLn left
  Text.putStrLn right

  -- Run two things concurrently and return the one that completes first
  result :: Either Text Text <-
    Async.race @Text @Text
       (Main.curl "https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Europe/London")
       (Main.curl "https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Europe/Rome")
  Either.either @Text @Text @(IO ()) Text.putStrLn Text.putStrLn result

curl = \(url :: Text) -> do
  (out, err) :: (Text, Text) <- Text.readProcess_ (Process.proc "curl" [url])
  IO.pure @Text out
```

## Description

### Design philosophy

Turtle, Shelly, shell-conduit and Shh are "do shell scripting in
Haskell", but lack something. GHC is a large dependency to require for
running scripts, and the Haskell ecosystem is not capable of the
stability required. Scripts written in them are brittle and clunky.

My definition of a shell scripting language:

* A small interpreted language capable of launching processes
* No abstraction or re-use capabilities from other
  files/modules/packages
* Small, portable binary
* Stable, does not change in backwards-incompatible ways

Hell can satisfy these criteria.

The other point of view that I've arrived at is that quotation like that of Bash and so on was never a good idea. I explored a Haskell that is quoted by default, such as `ls $(echo x)`, and realised that this way leads to madness. What you write in a REPL and what you write in a script file *can* be different.

The other design decisions are:

* Use existing Haskell naming convention, don't rename things for the
  sake of it. Even if the names Haskell chose aren't great, or are
  long.
* Lean on and re-use concepts in the host system, even if they're
  flawed. Haskell's standard libraries get a lot of things right, and
  some things wrong. But stick to the intuitions that already are
  there where possible.
* Don't break common shell understanding. Current directory and
  environment variables are process-wide, even if one would prefer
  otherwise. If you want "local" directories, carry a path around.
* Use established API patterns that already work. (In particular this
  applies to the process launching API, which "script in Haskell"
  always tend to re-invent. I'm just re-using the API of
  typed-process.)

Names mirror their equivalent Haskell names (typically the
package). `Data.Text` is `Text.*`, `Control.Concurrent.Async` is
`async`, etc.

One exception to this rule is avoiding `type String`. Sorry, it's hard
to justify when `Text` is established.

Also, avoiding operators, because operators are a bit harder to deal
with combined with type applications.

There is only one monad, `IO`. So all monadic actions are specialised
upon it.

`mapM`/`forM` are specialised on lists (like Haskell 98), and live
under the `IO.` namespace. In future, there could be `Maybe.mapM`,
etc. It's also possible to have `traverse @IO @[]` type of thing, but
that seems unnecessarily verbose. List is mostly fine, especially for
scripting purposes.

### More formal description

* The language is a simply-typed lambda calculus, with Haskell syntax.
* Some primitives that can be polymorphic (but require immediately
  applied type applications).
* Polymorphic primitives such as `id` require passing the type of the
  argument as `id @Int 123`. You cannot define polymorphic lambdas of
  your own. It's not full System-F.
* Recursion is not supported. Use `Function.fix`.
* Supports type-classes (`Eq`, `Ord` and `Show` only), but the type
  must still be explicitly supplied. You can't define classes, or data
  types, of your own.
* The types and functions available lean directly on the host language
  (Haskell) and are either directly lifted, or a simplified layer over
  the original things.
* There is presently no type inference (but I will add it). All
  parameters of lambdas, or do-notation let bindings, must have their
  type declared via a pattern signature: `\(x :: Int) -> x`
* Globals of any kind must be fully qualified (`Main.foo` and
  `Text.putstrLn`), including the current module.

## Instructions

### Running

Presently the `hell` binary type-checks and interprets immediately a
program in `IO`.

    $ hell examples/01-hello-world.hell
    Hello, World!

See https://github.com/chrisdone/hell/releases for a statically-linked
amd64 Linux binary.

### Building

Build statically for Linux in a musl distribution:

    stack build --ghc-options="-static -optl-static"

## Performance

I did a quick `fib` test and it does fine compared with
`runhaskell`. There might be some undue strictness or something; I
haven't looked deeply into it. What's important is that it's not dog
slow, and it isn't.

```haskell
import Data.Function
import Data.Bool
main = print $ fib (30::Int)

fib :: Int -> Int
fib = fix (\fib i ->
    bool
        (bool
           ( (fib (subtract 1 i))
            + (fib (subtract 2 i)))
          1
          (i == 1))
        0
        (i == 0)
    )
```
```haskell
main = do
  Text.putStrLn (Int.show (Main.fib 30))

fib =
  Function.fix @(Int -> Int)
    (\(fib :: Int -> Int) -> \(i :: Int) ->
      Bool.bool @Int
        (Bool.bool @Int
           (Int.plus (fib (Int.subtract 1 i))
                     (fib (Int.subtract 2 i)))
           1
           (Int.eq i 1))
        0
        (Int.eq i 0)
    )
```
