AI might take our jobs, that's bad for us, just like it was for the Luddites. 

But I think Herbert had it right when he, through his Dune books, proposed that 
the problem with "machine minds" is not the machine itself, it's "machine thinking" 
which humans are perfectly capable of. 

Related quotes from the books:

> What do such machines really do? They increase the number of things we can do without thinking. 
> Things we do without thinking — there's the real danger. (Leto Atreides II)

> “The target of the Jihad was a machine-attitude as much as the machines," Leto said. 

The brutal, uncompromising, inflexible, tyranny of, as Little Britain condensed it, 
"the computer says no." I'm more afraid of the encroachment of this chilling 
effect in my life than losing my job.
