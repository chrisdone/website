I believe Jacques Derrida's concept of différance is an opaque
rediscovery of the simple principle of yin and yang. White and
black. Front and back. True and false. Opposites.

His idea is that the meaning of a term is never totally present. The
meaning is _deferred_ to some other _different_ term. You can't have
white without black. You can't have front without back.

If you ask a normal person to define "front", they will likely say,
"well, it's the opposite of 'back'". So they deferred the meaning to
another word that's apparently different. Back is not-front. Front is
not-back.

This interplay arises with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who was
apparently influenced by the I Ching, in which yin and yang are
used in a combinatorial fashion, when he purportedly invented the
binary arithmetic system. 0s and 1s.

Later, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace developed the digital
computer, which is the foundation of all modern computing today.

When teaching the λ-calculus, there is a particularly blatant example
of différance in defining what exactly a lambda is and what exactly
function application is. Application has no sense without lambdas, and
lambdas have no use without application. You have to introduce the two
together.

Différance, binary, yin-yang, these are all the same insights.
