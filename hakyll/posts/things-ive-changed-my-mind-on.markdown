Here's a small blog post to end 2022. I've put together a list of things I've changed my
mind about over the past few years, since the epoch (covid). I'm likely to flesh out each 
of these in future posts.

Things I’ve changed my mind about:

1. Product types
2. Excel
3. Static types, dependent types, Rich Hickey, TLA+
4. Haskell and Haskellers, Rust
5. The cloud
6. Federation
7. Error handling/Erlang
8. Fat clients/ the SPA
9. React
10. macOS: it isn’t that great
11. Open source
12. Performance is easy
13. Kubernetes
14. Email
15. REST/hypermedia, Alan Kay
16. Code vs data
17. Modules
18. Go
19. Effect systems 
20. Twitter, federation, blogging, RSS

New things I believe/in:

1. Longevity in software
2. Stability in packages
3. Content Addressable Storage, Unison
4. Conservativism
5. Parsimony 
6. Common Lisp is valuable because it does everything it does, without ever changing or evolving.

Things I still believe/in:

1. Emacs reigns supreme
2. No-code isn’t good
3. Nix is not ready yet
