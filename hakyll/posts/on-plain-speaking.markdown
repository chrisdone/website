George Orwell on some guideline rules to writing:

> 1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
> 1. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
> 1. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
> 1. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
> 1. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
> 1. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright
>    barbarous.

Noam Chomsky on postmodernist writing:

> As for the "deconstruction" that is carried out (also mentioned in
> the debate), I can't comment, because most of it seems to me
> gibberish. But if this is just another sign of my incapacity to
> recognize profundities, the course to follow is clear: just restate
> the results to me in plain words that I can understand, and show why
> they are different from, or better than, what others had been doing
> long before and and have continued to do since without
> three-syllable words, incoherent sentences, inflated rhetoric that
> (to me, at least) is largely meaningless, etc. That will cure my
> deficiencies â€” of course, if they are curable; maybe they aren't, a
> possibility to which I'll return.
