<h1>Projects</h1>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>It might be a “getting old[-er]” thing, but I’ve recently started
feeling like documenting the complete set of software projects I’ve
worked on that I remember. Not as a CV (an advertisement of paid work),
but a comprehensive list of <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>I’ll start with the old stuff and continuously make updates a little
bit per day. After a few weeks I should be done.</p>

<h1 id="section">2012</h1>
<h2 id="fay">Fay</h2>
<p>I wrote a language called Fay, which was a Haskell without
type-classes that compiled to JavaScript, and used GHC’s type system for
the type-checking.</p>
<p>It ended up being quite popular, it garnered its own <a
href="https://github.com/faylang/">organization</a>, and I had a
comaintainer called Adam Bergmark, who was very nice and smart.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I was invited to and went to a conference in Lisbon to give a talk on
it.</p>
<p>FP Complete used it for their IDE which was a web based Haskell IDE,
which is pretty much how I got the job at FP Complete in 2013. A couple
years or so later, after the IDE project petered out, we stopped using
it. There were better options by then (PureScript, etc.).<a href="#fn2"

<h1 id="section-1">2011</h1>
<h2 id="hulk">Hulk</h2>
<p>I wrote an IRC server for use at work for us to chat on. We used it
for some years after we all left, until we eventually migrated to an app
called Wire (also written in Haskell).</p>
<p>This was my first proper experience using threading in Haskell and
working on a sockets server in Haskell. I would note that architecting
an IRC server in a nice way remains an unsolved problem in my head. In
any language.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="ji">Ji</h2>
<p>I wrote a library called <a href="/posts/ji-haskell-web/">Ji</a>,
which is a simple concept to write a web app in Haskell that sends
commands to a browser of what DOM changes to make and what events to
listen to.</p>
<p>It was taken over by Heinrich Apfelmus and renamed to <a
href="https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/threepenny-gui">threepenny-gui</a>,
after which he added many FRP-based things and has likely rewritten all
of it by this point.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">2010</h1>
<h2 id="lisk">Lisk</h2>
<p>I had enough hubris to think I would be able to write a Lisp syntax
on top of Haskell, and called it <a
href="/posts/lisk-lisp-haskell">Lisk</a>.</p>
<p>I was happy with Haskell, but bummed out by its syntax compared to
the beauty of Lisp. That hasn’t changed today in 2024.</p>

<h1 id="section-3">2008</h1>
<h2 id="kibro">Kibro</h2>
<p>In 2008 I was working for a small sum on a hair salon’s new web site,
in Haskell. And I made a very trivial web library called “Kibro” (from
the Lojban “cyberspace”), which sat upon CGI and could be ran from PHP,
which is how I was running it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Source code archive: <a
href="/archives/2008/kibro-0.5.0.tar.gz">kibro-0.5.0.tar.gz</a></li>
<li>Other links: <a
href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/kibro-refactoring/">Kibro
refactoring</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lojbot">lojbot</h2>
<p>Around this time I was an enthusiastic Lojban hobbyist, so I wrote an
IRC bot with various capabilitis.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="section-4">2006</h1>
<h2 id="slsksoulski">SLSK/Soulski</h2>
<p>A project for the Soulseek music sharing network. Web site, which may
not remain long-term: <a
href="https://slsk.sourceforge.net/">slsk.sourceforge.net</a>.
Amusingly, it still looks great. <a
href="/images/blog/slsk-screenshot-2007.png">Here’s a screenshot.</a> <a
href="/images/blog/slsk.jpeg">Another</a>. I started writing a C library
for Soulseek: <a
href="/archives/2006/soulski/soulseek-library-0.01.zip">soulseek-library-0.01.zip</a>
I started writing a GUI library in C for it: <a
href="/archives/2006/soulski/exgui-library-0.1.zip">exgui-library-0.1.zip</a>
I started writing a CSS parser in C for it: <a
href="/archives/2006/soulski/css-library-prototype-0.01.zip">css-library-prototype-0.01.zip</a></p>
<p>I originally had big ambitions for this, but later lost interest. It
looks like I planned to rewrite it in Common Lisp, but got bored of the
project before I did.</p>
<h2 id="wdn">WDN</h2>
<p>I had a project called ‘windows desktop notes’ (WDN), that I
originally <a href="/archives/2006/wdm/slsk-code-r110-wdm.zip">wrote in
C</a>. It would overlay some plain text notes on your desktop and you
could click it and get an edit box and then hit Enter to save again.</p>
<p>Then I ported it, or tried to, <a
href="/archives/2006/wdn/wdn.lisp">to Lisp</a>.</p>

<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>In retrospect I mishandled a situation where Fay was
being used in production and we were breaking its APIs too often, and I
blocked Adam’s <code>master</code> push access to the repo to give me
some breathing room to slow things down, but this was obviously the
wrong move, and not how you should treat early collaborators. That was
my first experience managing a project, so I cut my younger self some
slack. However, he was very gracious about it in the moment.<a
