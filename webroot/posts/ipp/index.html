<h1>Immutable Publishing Policy</h1>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This is a policy for publishing Haskell packages. It was published in
<strong>February of 2022</strong>. The aim of this policy is to remove
all breaking changes to downstream users of packages, where feasible. It
is most applicable to packages which have users, and/or have a more or
less stable API. It prioritizes downstream users at the expense of
author convenience.</p>
<p>It has been implemented in the <a
href="https://github.com/chrisdone/lucid">lucid</a> package.</p>
<h3 id="terms">Terms</h3>
<p>By “levels” in this description, we mean “module” is the first level,
and “package” is the level above.</p>
<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you <strong>require more</strong>, that’s a break.
<ul>
<li>E.g. adding an extra field to a record or requiring a class
constraint, add an extra constructor which users can pattern match on,
or another package dependency or newer major version of a package that
wasn’t needed before.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you <strong>provide less</strong>, that’s a break.
<ul>
<li>E.g. if you remove an export or a field of a record, return less or
different from a function, remove a module, or an instance of an exposed
type.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you <strong>change something</strong>, that’s a break of the next
level up.
<ul>
<li>E.g. if you change the type signature of an exposed function, or
change a data type’s definition which is exposed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you <strong>just add</strong> something, then just bump the minor
version (which is the only thing that changes in this scheme) of the
package; you can use the current date e.g. <code>0.0.20210101</code>.
<ul>
<li>E.g. a non-orphan instance of a type from your own package.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Haskell-specific note:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you add an orphan instance in your library–which you
<strong>should not do</strong>–that’s definitely a breaking change for
the whole package, <strong>bump the package.</strong></li>
<li>A user may have written an orphan instance for one of your types,
but this is a departure from standard practice, and therefore isn’t
protected from breaking change. You should feel free to <strong>add new
instances</strong> for your own types.</li>
<li><a href="https://pvp.haskell.org/#leaking-instances">Be careful
about leaking instances</a>. If you bump your package when you bump your
dependencies major versions, then you should be safe from this.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<p>This <strong>differs substantially to <a
href="https://pvp.haskell.org/">the PVP</a>.</strong> ⚠️</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to change a thing <code>foo</code>, just make a copy of
it and call it <code>foo2</code>.</li>
<li>If it’s impractical to add another version of a thing (because,
e.g. you changed a class or a data type that’s used in many places),
then copy the whole module <code>Foo</code> to <code>Foo2</code>.</li>
<li>If it’s impractical to just copy a module, then it’s time to copy
the package, <code>foo</code> to <code>foo2</code>.</li>
<li>If you want to rename or remove something from a module, clone the
module. If you want to remove or rename a module, clone the
package.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s more effort for an author to make breaking changes. The author
pays a price, and has to think twice about whether it’s worth it.</li>
<li>The user <strong>optionally</strong> pays a small price to upgrade
to new functionality, rather than a <em>mandatory tax</em> for changes
they don’t want, which is the PVP system.</li>
<li>For more elaboration, watch Rich Hickey’s video <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk">Spec-ulation</a>.</li>
<li>Related mantra of the Linux kernel: <em><a
href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/235335/why-is-there-a-linux-kernel-policy-to-never-break-user-space">don’t
break user-space</a></em></li>
<li>I don’t agree at all with <a
href="http://blog.ezyang.com/2016/12/thoughts-about-spec-ulation-rich-hickey/">this
post</a> by ezyang</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="long-term-steps">Long-term steps</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can publish additions to your old versions of modules and
packages.</li>
<li>You can choose to stop maintaining them at some point. For example,
a duplicate module hierarchy. You can just drop the old one and publish
a new package.</li>
<li>By the PVP, packages that use your package will force their users to
use your newer API, which will make them unhappy. By following the IPP,
you give your users the chance to import both library versions and maybe
write some migrations between the two versions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="infrastructuretechnical-support">Infrastructure/technical
support</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hackage supports deprecating a package in favour of something else.
That’s your means to tell users of newer versions.</li>
<li>GHC lets you mark declarations and modules as deprecated, which is
issued as a warning.</li>
<li>Users can use
<code>module Lib (module Lib2) where import Lib2</code> to try newer
versions of module hierarchies as “drop-ins”.</li>
<li>For a package following the IPP, you can just depend on
<code>package &gt;= 0.0.n</code> where <code>n</code> is the feature
that you need. You never need an upper bound because there are no
breaking changes.</li>
<li>Both Hackage and Stackage will allow you to upload package1,
package2, etc. and so your users can continue to use the package1 if
they’re not interested in package2, and if they’re not forced by
PVP-following maintainers of other packages that they’re using.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compatibility-with-the-pvp">Compatibility with the PVP</h3>
<p>You can do both, the IPP is a subset of behavior within the PVP (but
upper bounds aren’t required or needed by the IPP). In practice, people
following just the PVP and not the IPP will be a pain for you as
Haskellers change things and cause breakage all the time. But don’t
bother people about it. Just do your best.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-use-this-policy">When to use this policy</h3>
<p>I propose that you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put new experimental packages on GitHub/GitLab/sourcehut, etc. and
using Stack or Cabal you can specify dependencies on that package by a
commit hash. At this stage, authors can change as much as they want and
users can pin to commits.</li>
<li>If your design becomes stable and you want to support the package,
put it on Stackage or Hackage. Now apply IPP.</li>
</ul>
<p>For packages already published, you can apply IPP immediately.</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
<h4 id="do-you-just-want-unison">Do you just want Unison?</h4>
<p>Sure, but that’s a whole new language. Haskell is our language of
choice, so let’s do our best to make it nicer to use.</p>
<h4
id="its-not-worth-doing-because-we-should-have-machines-automate-dependencies-based-on-fine-grained-uses">It’s
not worth doing because we should have machines automate dependencies
based on fine grained uses</h4>
<p>That’s true. Here in the real world, however, no such automation
exists.</p>
<h4
id="security-fixes-can-be-breaking-changes-we-should-make-bad-code-go-away">Security
fixes can be breaking changes, we should make bad code go away</h4>
<p>You don’t know how and in what setting your users are using your
libraries. It’s not your place to bully them into changing their
programs because you know better.</p>
<h4 id="shouldnt-old-code-be-garbage-collected">Shouldn’t old code be
garbage collected?</h4>
<p>Yes, I covered deprecation above. I also covered removing old code
and the ending of maintenance above.</p>
<h4
id="what-if-i-add-a-constructor-to-a-type-id-have-to-duplicate-my-whole-api">What
if <em>I</em> add a constructor to a type? <em>I’d</em> have to
duplicate my whole API!</h4>
<p>Yes. If <em>you</em> add a new constructor then <em>you’ll</em>
indeed <strong>require more</strong> of the consumer of your package to
form a complete pattern match. Duplicate the type. <em>You</em> changed
a namespace.</p>
<p>I’ll repeat myself: the IPP is about valuing the user’s time over the
maintainer’s time. <em>It’s not all about you and your needs.</em> Think
about others who have to consume your work.</p>
<h4
id="why-have-package-versions-when-you-are-going-to-duplicate-an-entire-module-or-package-when-you-make-a-breaking-change">Why
have package versions when you are going to duplicate an entire module
or package when you make a breaking change?</h4>
<p>I already covered this above, but let’s rewrite in a different way:
Package versions in Haskell are broken. They force all package
maintainers to move in lock step. You can only practically use
<strong>one</strong> version of a package in your installed package
scope.</p>
<p>If you want to keep using foo-1.2.3 and another package you’re using
wants foo-2.0.0, you shouldn’t be forced to change all your code. You
should be given the option to migrate between them.</p>
