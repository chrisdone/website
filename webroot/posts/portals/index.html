<h1>Portals in Emacs</h1>

<p>I’ve been working on a new way to launch and manage processes in
Emacs in <a
href="https://github.com/chrisdone/emacs-config/blob/00e0d01b7f28cff4f16ac2ec5e98581f2969de84/packages/portal/portal.el">my
personal repo</a>. It’s an alternative to shells. A bit like a notebook.
It also partially serves the same need that Prodigy-mode does. The name
is evocative of that video game Portal from 2007.</p>
<p>It has a major mode, where <code>M-!</code> is rebound to Portal’s
way of running shell scripts. It inserts a nano-ID for the portal,
e.g. <code>portal_abc123456sdkjfal</code>, as text into the buffer at
the current point. It creates a corresponding directory under
<code>~/.portals/</code>. All stdout and stderr are redirected to files
under <code>~/.portals/{stdout,stderr,command,directory,env}</code>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this is that Emacs can lock up a bit when you run a
very long running process, or one that spews output very quickly.
Instead of storing it in a buffer or displaying all of it, Portal just
writes it all to a file and displays a little preview of it anywhere in
the buffer that the portal’s nano-ID is.</p>
<p>The preview is updated every couple seconds, it’s not instant. That
design is intentional, so that no process can ever really overwhelm
Emacs. It’s an extremely aggressive design. Even the line length in the
preview is limited to 80 columns.</p>
<p>Another motiviation is simply UX-based, which is that I run a lot of
commands at work that spit out a bunch of useless output. Like
Terraform, Cabal, GHC, etc. Most of the output is not of interest, but
occasionally, one does one to read the output.</p>
<p>Example, below:</p>
<pre><code>portal_M2FjMjMyZWIxZjI4MTNmN
# (0) ls
# package.yaml
# readme.md
# scripts
# stack.yaml
# stack.yaml.lock

portal_ZmZhZThiMmFiNzQ1Y2E3N
# (run) stack build
# Preparing to download ghc-tinfo6-libc6-pre232-9.4.8 ...
# ghc-tinfo6-libc6-pre232-9.4.8: download has begun
# ghc-tinfo6-libc6-pre232-9.4.8:  256.00 KiB / 178.01 MiB (  0.14%) downloaded..
# ghc-tinfo6-libc6-pre232-9.4.8:  432.00 KiB / 178.01 MiB (  0.24%) downloaded..
# ghc-tinfo6-libc6-pre232-9.4.8:  736.00 KiB / 178.01 MiB (  0.40%) downloaded..</code></pre>
<p>The (0) indicates a successful exit. The command, stdout and stderr
have different colours. In the major mode, you put your cursor over them
and hit RET and it’ll pop open the file for you.</p>
<p>The other reason for storing all of this is that one can restart
Emacs and re-open a file containing portals and see what was ran, and
re-launch them if desired, with the same arguments, directory, etc.</p>
<p>I often use <code>M-x portal-edit</code> to tweak a command line,
which prompts in the mini-buffer with the existing text to edit. After
hitting RET, it restarts the portal for you.
<code>M-x portal-rerun</code> does what you’d expect.</p>
<p>All newly ran portals get a new nano-ID, so you can always go back
and find the outputs of a previously ran portal.</p>
<p>Emacs handles all the stdout and stderr, so it could in theory be
possible to pipe from one portal to another. One could even attach and
detach portals to/from one another, or edit arguments and restart, while
some of processes are still running. But I haven’t explored this because
it’s more of a side-effect of my design than an intentional part of
it.</p>
<p>It also works perfectly with envrc mode, which is how Emacs
integrates with direnv.</p>
<p><code>C-c C-c</code> on a portal will interrupt the process, as
expected.</p>
<p>I’ve been using this for a few weeks and frankly I’m surprised how
well it works and fits my workflow. At work I have a foo.portals buffer
which has 30 portals in it. Of those, 3 are presently running, the rest
are things I can scroll through and re-run when I feel like it. I save
the file, so I can always restart Emacs and lose nothing.</p>
<p>I’m not interested in maintaining it as a “package.” But in the
spirit of Emacs, I am interested in sharing the code, so that others can
rip, riff and remix! Hope someone found this fun!</p>
