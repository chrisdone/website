<h1>What’s wrong with the grid?</h1>

<p>The grid system in spreadsheets is very simple. It’s also very
powerful, and it’s powerful because it’s simple. As a user you can
immediately start entering data without even thinking about it. And
then, in an ad hoc fashion, you can add logic and conditions as you
think of them.</p>
<h2 id="lack-of-boundaries-cause-bugs">Lack of boundaries cause
bugs</h2>
<p>This fast and loose paradigm is also the downfall of spreadsheets,
because the user is encouraged to do a form of programming, without
encouraging them to do any kind of discipline. Spreadsheets quickly get
out of hand. The boundaries are arbitrary, and usually are only visual,
which means it’s very difficult to write good code based on this.</p>
<p>For example, there is the famous case of a large spreadsheet used in
an economics paper, called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_a_Time_of_Debt#Methodological_flaws">Growth
in a time of Debt</a>, and there was a miscalculation because a few rows
at the end of a list of items were not taken into account, as, per usual
in a spreadsheet, the user specified them in a range. It has been
criticised anywhere from a gross oversight to disastrous.</p>
<h2 id="proper-data-structures-are-simpler">Proper data structures are
simpler</h2>
<p>However, in normal programming, we don’t have just one data
structure. The grid is just one data structure, a matrix of practically
infinite width and height. You can access its elements by coordinates.
But in programming––normal programming––we have, for example, lists. If
a proper list data structure were were used for the list of elements in
the above example, there wouldn’t have been this bug, because you don’t
have to specify how many elements of a list you want to work on. We just
say “apply this function to all elements of the list.”</p>
<p>Data structures like lists and matrices can all be approximated in a
spreadsheet by a grid, badly. However, anything more than this becomes
awkward very quickly.</p>
<p>For example, a simple record consisting of a name and an age in a
spreadsheet must be modelled by using a cell for the label of the name
and label of the age, and then the value for each thing. This is a hack,
using superficial visual embellishments to reflect what is actually
data.</p>
<p>In normal programming languages, this is called a record. There’s no
need for any kind of strange and brittle hacking and tricks to make this
work as you have to do in a spreadsheet. The basic spreadsheet, as-is,
is very accessible to the normal person who just wants to do every day
calculations about their business. But the ideas of a record, list, tree
or graph are also intuitive for normal people because they actually
model the kind of data that their domain is dealing with. Sadly,
knowledge workers using spreadsheets are deprived of these tools.</p>
<h2 id="data-modelling-is-poor">Data modelling is poor</h2>
<p>Therefore we find spreadsheets very lacking, in fact, when we try to
model even every day pedestrian problems. Consider for example trying to
model a family tree, or the hierarchical structure of the US government,
or a taxonomy of a species.</p>
<p>Trees are three data structures, perfectly normal, well understood,
pliable, things that you can express in a programming language and
manipulate using code in a very logical manner. You can count how many
items are in the tree, you can restrict the tree to a certain branch,
perform a transformation on each node in the tree, or transpose the tree
and flip it upside down!</p>
<p>Another example is a graph. For example, the Coronavirus can be
modelled by its spread using a graph the graph consists of a set of
people in the connections between those people. You can easily write
code to count how many connections a given node has to it; that’s a
normal graph operation. Or count how many transitive node are connected
to it in one direction, in other words; you can measure the influences
of one person within a community.</p>
<p>Aside from using code to manipulate said data structures, your user
interface should allow you to click a node and edit the text, maybe
write some code in there, like any other type of cell.</p>
<p>Both of those things are impossible, practically, to describe, talk
about, express, manipulate, or visualise, in a traditional grid-based
spreadsheet!</p>
<p>So, we’ve established two things so far. The first is that the grid
system lacks boundaries between different data structures, which can
lead to bugs. Second is that there are actually very normal, every day,
useful data structures which we should, in a reasonable system, be able
to express, but which the grid system is unable to express.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have seen that these data structures actually have
very well understood and rich and useful operations which work only if
you have that kind of data structure.</p>
<p>But a spreadsheet simply has one single data structure: the grid.
And, the only elements that you can put in that data structure are
numbers, strings and dates. In other words, atomic values. But that’s
not real life. There’s no reason that I should not be able to have a
list of lists. Or a tree of records. Or a list of records (aka a
“table”). I should, hypothetically, be able to arbitrarily nest data
structures as it fits my problem.</p>
<h2 id="correctness-checks">Correctness checks</h2>
<p>Turning to a different topic, when you have different data
structures, you can start to add checks that help you avoid making other
types of mistakes. If your system knows the shape of data, it can have
expectations about how you use it.</p>
<p>You can add a type system to the system. The purpose of a type system
is to make sure that you are combining your different operations
together in a way that makes sense. Not putting a square peg in around
hole. For example, you can calculate the sum of an list, of a graph, of
a tree. However, you cannot concatenate a graph to an list. What would
that even mean?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, we’ve looked at reasons why a traditional spreadsheet
grid system is lacking in several key areas of expression, correctness,
and even convenience, in a way that is actually important for normal
knowledge work and not just for programmers.</p>
<p>If you look through various competitors to the established
spreadsheet vendors, you’ll see a lot of “reinvent spreadsheets”
language. But it’s always the same thing: we have a grid system with
coordinates and an underwhelming untyped expression language. But they
added JavaScript or Python to it, or added a “low-code” app generator on
top of the spreadsheet, or some special views.</p>
<p>We’re working on <a href="https://inflex.io/">a system called
Inflex</a> that really does rethink the spreadsheet fundamentally from
the ground up. And the first thing to be thrown out is the grid, the
coordinate system and replace them with real data structures and a type
system.</p>
<p>We keep what’s <em>good</em> about spreadsheets: the reactivity and
“edit-in-place” user experience.</p>
<p>In our next post we’ll be discussing the fundamental problems with
the expression/formula languages used in spreadsheet software, and how
we are fixing it.</p>
