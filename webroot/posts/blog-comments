      <h1>Comments on my blog</h1>
<p class="author">By <a href="https://chrisdone.com/">Chris Done</a></p>

<p>Comments are unsupported on my blog for the same reason as <a href="https://www.scripting.com/2007/01/01.html#theUneditedVoiceOfAPerson">Dave Winer</a> gives:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…to the extent that comments interfere with the natural expression of the unedited voice of an individual, comments may act to make something not a blog…. The cool thing about blogs is that while they may be quiet, and it may be hard to find what you’re looking for, at least you can say what you think without being shouted down. This makes it possible for unpopular ideas to be expressed. And if you know history, the most important ideas often are the unpopular ones…. That’s what’s important about blogs, not that people can comment on your ideas. As long as they can start their own blog, there will be no shortage of places to comment.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joel Spolsky first exposed me to the above. He elaborates <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/07/20.html">in his blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The important thing to notice here is that Dave does not see blog comments as productive to the free exchange of ideas. They are a part of the problem, not the solution. You don’t have a right to post your thoughts at the bottom of someone else’s thoughts. That’s not freedom of expression, that’s an infringement on their freedom of expression. Get your own space, write compelling things, and if your ideas are smart, they’ll be linked to, and Google will notice, and you’ll move up in PageRank, and you’ll have influence and your ideas will have power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I wanted to have my expression shared and democratised I’d comment on a forum.</p>
<p>People email me regarding my blog with ideas and errata/amendments all the time, I’m glad for them, and I reply.</p>
