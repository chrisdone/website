<h1>Reports of RSS/Atom’s death are greatly exaggerated</h1>

<p>I’m not old, but I remember when people said “my web log.” That then
became “blog.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I subscribe via a feed reader<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> to a collection of
individual blogs, and a few aggregators (but only the top posts of the
week).</p>
<p>This strikes a good balance of interesting reads (mostly technology
and programming related), and keeping my finger on the pulse of what the
tech world is excited about (big data, IoT, NoSQL, cloud, VR, crypto,
AI, insert trend du jour here).</p>
<p>It also means I only have about 30 or so new posts per day appearing
in my feed, and they can be flicked through in a few minutes. I’ll
bookmark ones that sound interesting to read for when I’m at home and
sitting comfortably. “Screen time” and FOMO are not problems for me.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I can also setup filters for
bullshit content mill authors.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>However, about once a fortnight–on my RSS feed–I regularly see a post
debating why RSS has died, or why it’s making a comeback. There’s
usually related discussion about adoption, the user experience, or
corporate interests (Google Reader, or $popular_newspaper).<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>For people who digest things over a course of days or weeks, rather
than doom scrolling and posting their knee-jerk reactions, the situation
for a very broad set of people is that RSS/Atom is in the background
doing what it’s supposed to. No VC-backed endless growth, or
decline.</p>
<p>Feeds continue to serve their modest purpose.</p>
<p>For people lamenting the death of Google Reader, or that Mozilla
dropped the built-in feed icon and reader from Firefox: don’t. Be
thankful that the Great Eye of Business has lost interest in RSS and
does not want to meddle in it anymore.</p>

grown up since then. A little bit.<a href="#fnref1"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I get my other news from more traditional sources in
dead tree format. And I don’t use Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter,
Threads, or other drugs. According to The Economist, people are no
longer posting or getting their news from social networks anyway; it’s
all happening in private chat groups.<a href="#fnref2"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Partly thanks to Musk completely bungling Twitter, which
was already on thin ice for me. I (along with many others) migrated to
Mastodon, and then lost interest in any kind of “microblogging” at all.
Other people have just deleted their accounts. Similar to Reddit,
really. Tech communites have largely moved to Discourse.<a
href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Such as Substack, Medium, etc. For future readers who
might not know what these platforms were, they’re just another type of
blogging service, but are extremely aggressive at bothering you to “sign
up to my newsletter” (literally–not a joke), and the posts are almost
all inflammatory, self-promotion, or attempts to direct you to a product
or service.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>You’ll see a similar pattern of discussion about email,
another distributed internet standard. Unfortunately Big Business is
presently a spectre looming over email.<a href="#fnref5"
